Context / notes
- Repo currently serves a hand-built Bootstrap site from root (index.html + pages/); custom domain is mdsz.ca (CNAME in repo root).
- Images live in imgs/ (profile pics, KAMI project shots, code backgrounds); docs/ is empty now but git status shows deleted PDFs (old resume/reports).
- GitHub Pages likely builds from the root of this user-site repo; decide whether to keep root publish or switch to docs/ or gh-pages.

Hugo + Terminal migration (priority order)
1) Scaffold Hugo
   - Install Hugo extended locally; create a new Hugo site (e.g., site/ or root) with clean config (TOML/YAML).
   - Add the Terminal theme (git submodule, Hugo module, or vendored copy) and enable it in the config.
2) Configure metadata
   - Set baseURL to https://mdsz.ca, site title/name, language, and author.
   - Define menus (Home, Projects, About/Resume, Contact) in the config; choose single-page vs sectioned navigation.
   - Preserve custom domain by keeping CNAME in the published output (static/CNAME or root).
3) Content pass
   - Write a concise landing intro/hero blurb; reuse updated headshot from imgs/ in static/.
   - Create Projects section (content/projects) with a few current items and reuse relevant images; drop noisy backgrounds.
   - Add About page and link to a refreshed resume PDF placed in static/resume.pdf.
   - Add Contact/social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email) using Terminal theme params/partials.
4) Styling tweaks within theme settings
   - Choose minimal accent colors and typography options offered by Terminal; keep layout sparse/clean.
   - Turn off unused widgets/sections; verify dark/light choice matches the desired minimal look.
5) Deploy pipeline
   - Decide publishing target: commit generated public/ to root/docs or deploy to gh-pages via GitHub Actions (peaceiris/actions-hugo or hugo --minify -> pages upload).
   - Ensure the CNAME is included in the published artifact; test `hugo server -D` locally, then `hugo --minify` for production.
6) Cleanup & docs
   - Remove legacy HTML/CSS once the Hugo site is live.
   - Add README with build/run/deploy steps; update .gitignore for Hugo build artifacts (public/, resources/).

Questions to settle
- Prefer single-page flow vs separate sections?
- Which projects to highlight (and are the current imgs/ still relevant)?
- Provide a new resume PDF? (old one is missing)
