Context / notes
- Repo currently serves a hand-built Bootstrap site from root (index.html + pages/); custom domain is mdsz.ca (CNAME in repo root).
- Images live in imgs/ (profile pics, KAMI project shots, code backgrounds); docs/ is empty now but git status shows deleted PDFs (old resume/reports).
- GitHub Pages likely builds from the root of this user-site repo; decide whether to keep root publish or switch to docs/ or gh-pages.


TODO NEXT

Overall Goal: add detailed sections about the work exerince I've done and projects I've build. They should be short to-the-point glances that expand and give conext to  my resume bullet poitns.

1. start with industry experince. From my resume copy the notes into a text file. From there create sections in the website which start to outline the work I've done.
2. need to refine PDF uploads
