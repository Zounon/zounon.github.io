description = '''
During my time at Rivian, I followed features from inception to release: I presented test plans, developing automated tests, and ensured PM, Design, and Devs were aligned throughout.

I built a cmdline tool which enables QA to mock responses from NATS servers.

And I'm especially proud of the rare opporuntiy to manage the entire 2.21 mobile release cycle.

Location: Vancouver, BC  




## Overview
Owned the release execution for v2.21 while scaling automated UI and API coverage across Android and iOS. The goal was to keep the release cadence predictable, reduce manual testing, and keep QA aligned with product and engineering.

## What I shipped
- Led a sub-team of four through the full release cycle with PM, design, and dev.
- Built PyTest + Appium automation in GitHub Actions for simulated and bench vehicles.
- Expanded Android and iOS coverage and isolated regressions early.
- Mentored junior interns on test design, debugging, and automation fundamentals.

## Impact
- Improved release confidence by increasing automated coverage across platforms.
- Reduced coordination overhead by keeping release status and blockers visible.

## Stack
Python, PyTest, Appium, GitHub Actions, Android Studio (Java/Kotlin), Xcode (Swift)
