## Overview
Focused on building a reliable E2E suite that matched the most common user flows so feature releases could ship faster without manual regression cycles.

## What I shipped
- Authored 200 Playwright tests in TypeScript covering new features and 85% of top user flows.
- Integrated the suite into CI/CD to provide fast feedback for engineers.
- Led cross-team triage to align on severity and ownership.

## Impact
- Significantly reduced manual testing load and shortened release feedback loops.
- Clearer bug ownership improved release predictability.
