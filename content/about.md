I'm a Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University who likes turning ideas into reliable software. I bias for clarity, concise solutions, and fast feedback loops.

Things I enjoy:

- Building small, focused tools that solve real problems.
- Working close to users and iterating quickly.
- Learning by shipping, reading code, and asking good questions.
